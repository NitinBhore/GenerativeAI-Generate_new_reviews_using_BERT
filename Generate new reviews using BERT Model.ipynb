    "* The similarity scores between the original and generated reviews are calculated using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improvements:\n",
    "* Increase the size of the dataset: The code is currently using only a subset of the data (head(1000)) due to the limitation of system configuartion. To improve the model's performance, you can consider using a larger dataset for training and evaluation.\n",
